The juxtaposition of vibrant greenery against the sleek urban skyline creates a futuristic yet organic setting that fashion photographers are flocking to.",
          "The gardens feature translucent walkways that play with light, creating ethereal effects ideal for capturing flowing fabrics and delicate textures.
