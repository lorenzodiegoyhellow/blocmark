Project Goal:
Redesign the "Why List with Blocmark?" and "Why Choose Blocmark?" sections of the Blocmark homepage to feel bold, premium, and cinematic, while keeping a clean, minimal aesthetic. Use Tailwind CSS and optionally Framer Motion or GSAP for subtle animations.
✨ Design Requirements:
🔷 1. General Layout

    Replace toggle buttons ("Property Owner" / "Renter") with either:

        Scroll-triggered split sections, OR

        Animated tabs that transition between "Hosts" and "Renters" sections

    Add a full-width hero visual (image or background video) at the top of this block, with a strong header and subheadline:

    Header: Your Space. Their Vision. One Effortless Platform.
    Subheadline: Blocmark empowers creators and property owners to connect through curated, intelligent, and frictionless bookings.

🔷 2. Section A – For Hosts (Property Owners)

Display six cards with bold icons, bolder titles, and updated copy:
Icon	Title	Description
💸	Get Paid in 24h	Forget 30-day payouts. We transfer your money within 24 hours of a completed booking.
🗓️	Own Your Schedule	You’re in control — set your own calendar and blackout dates with one click.
🛡️	Peace of Mind	Each booking includes damage & liability coverage, automatically.
🚀	Zero to Booked Fast	No setup fees. No monthly costs. Start earning today.
🌍	Spotlight Exposure	Be discovered in curated features, collections, and editorial picks.
🎛️	Effortless Control	A modern dashboard to manage everything from bookings to payments, beautifully.

    Include a quote/testimonial at the bottom:

        “I listed my studio on Blocmark and booked 4 shoots in the first week — without lifting a finger.”
        — Mia R., DTLA property owner

🔷 3. Section B – For Renters (Creators)

Display another set of six bold feature cards:
Icon	Title	Description
✅	Verified. Vetted. Valued.	Every space is handpicked by our team. No randomness, no surprises.
🤖	AI That Gets You	Tell us what you need — our AI matches you with the perfect space instantly.
🔒	Book With Confidence	Secure payments. Transparent terms. You’re covered.
⏱️	Book in Minutes	Search. Chat. Book. All in one smooth flow.
🔦	Hidden Gems Await	Discover secret corners, off-the-grid gems, and exclusive listings.
🧠	Smart Support	Our AI and real people are available 24/7 to guide you.

    Include a quote/testimonial at the bottom:

        “Blocmark’s AI found me a location I wouldn’t have found in 100 hours of searching. Unreal.”
        — Brandon G., filmmaker

🔷 4. Interactivity & Motion

    Add hover animations for cards (subtle glow, icon animation, or shadow lift).

    Use staggered entry animation for the cards (e.g., fade-up or slide-in).

    Tabs/sections should have smooth transitions when switching.

🔷 5. Call to Action (Final)

End with a full-width CTA section:

Header: Ready to turn your space into a film set? Or find your next dream shoot location?

Buttons:
[ I’m a Property Owner → ]
[ I’m a Renter / Creator → ]

On mobile: stack buttons full width, with transitions on hover.
✅ Tech Requirements:

    Use Tailwind CSS for styling

    Optional: Framer Motion or GSAP for animation

    Must be responsive on all screen sizes

    Code should be modular and clean for easy integration into the existing homepage
