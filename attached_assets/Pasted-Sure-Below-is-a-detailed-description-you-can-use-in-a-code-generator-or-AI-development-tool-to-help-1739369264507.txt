Sure! Below is a detailed description you can use in a code generator or AI development tool to help build the Blocmark platform. This description outlines the core functionalities, tech stack preferences, and system architecture to guide the tool in generating relevant code.

Blocmark – AI-Powered Location Booking Platform

Project Overview:
Blocmark is a curated, AI-driven marketplace for booking locations for film shoots, photography, and events. Unlike traditional platforms, Blocmark offers a fully automated booking process where AI acts as an intermediary, ensuring efficiency, exclusivity, and security. Property owners list locations, and clients can browse, request, and book locations seamlessly.

Technical Requirements:

1. Tech Stack
	•	Frontend: React.js (Next.js for SEO optimization), TailwindCSS for styling
	•	Backend: Node.js (NestJS or Express.js), PostgreSQL (for structured location and user data)
	•	AI Engine: Python (FastAPI or Flask) with OpenAI API or custom ML models
	•	Authentication: Firebase Auth / OAuth 2.0 / JWT
	•	Storage: AWS S3 (for media files), Cloudinary (for optimized images)
	•	Payments: Stripe / PayPal API
	•	Infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes (for scaling), AWS EC2 / DigitalOcean Droplets
	•	Notifications: Websockets (Socket.io) + Email (SendGrid/Mailgun)

2. User Roles & Access

A) Property Owners
	•	Apply to list their properties (curation required before approval)
	•	Upload high-resolution images, description, and pricing details
	•	Manage bookings via dashboard (view requests, earnings, schedule)
	•	Can request AI-powered insights on pricing and demand
	•	Payment system integration to receive payouts (Stripe/PayPal)

B) Clients (Filmmakers, Event Planners, Photographers)
	•	Browse curated locations via AI-powered recommendations
	•	Request bookings (with optional AI-generated availability suggestions)
	•	Secure automated booking process (no direct owner-client communication)
	•	Integrated payment processing & invoicing
	•	AI chatbot for instant support & custom recommendations

C) Admin Panel
	•	Review & approve new locations
	•	Manage users, transactions, and reports
	•	Oversee AI-powered pricing and demand analytics

3. Core Features & Functionalities

A) AI-Driven Search & Booking
	•	Natural Language Search: Users can describe their needs (e.g., “A vintage loft with large windows”) and AI suggests relevant locations.
	•	Auto-Pricing & Demand Prediction: AI recommends prices based on similar listings, seasonal demand, and user interest.
	•	Instant & Request-Based Booking: Some locations can be booked instantly, while others require owner approval.

B) AI-Powered Concierge
	•	AI chatbot (GPT-like) helps users find locations based on budget, theme, and logistics.
	•	Automated messaging & notifications for booking confirmations, reminders, and updates.

C) Smart Contracts & Secure Payments
	•	Secure transactions with escrow-like system (funds released after booking completion).
	•	AI tracks transaction history to prevent fraud.
	•	Dynamic refund policies based on cancellation timeframe.

D) User Dashboard
	•	Property Owners: View earnings, manage listings, track bookings.
	•	Clients: Track upcoming bookings, invoices, saved locations.

E) Review & Rating System
	•	Verified-only reviews (only users who booked a location can review it).
	•	AI flags fake or spam reviews.

F) Multi-Currency & Language Support
	•	USD, EUR, GBP, and others.
	•	AI auto-translates listings based on user preference.

4. API Integrations
	•	Stripe / PayPal for payments
	•	Google Maps API for location previews & distance calculation
	•	OpenAI API (for AI chatbot & recommendations)
	•	Twilio / SendGrid for notifications

5. Security & Data Protection
	•	User verification: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for property owners.
	•	Data encryption: Secure storage of user and financial data.
	•	Role-based access: Admins, owners, and clients have different access levels.

6. Scalability & Performance
	•	Microservices architecture for modular, scalable components.
	•	CDN (Cloudflare) for fast image delivery.
	•	Server-side rendering (SSR) with Next.js for SEO optimization.

Expected Outcome from Code Generator
	•	Generate a basic project structure with the defined tech stack.
	•	Scaffold core functionalities (authentication, search, booking system).
	•	Set up API routes & database models (for locations, users, transactions).
	•	Implement AI chatbot & recommendation engine for user queries.

This description should give the code generator detailed guidance on what to build while keeping the structure flexible for future iterations. Would you like me to refine any specific part or add additional technical details?
